## What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API uses HTTP requests to access and use data, following these principles:

- **Stateless**: Each request contains all information needed to process it
- **Resource-based**: URLs represent resources, not actions
- **Standard HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- **Uniform interface**: Consistent way of interacting with resources
